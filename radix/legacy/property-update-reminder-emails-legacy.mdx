A Property Update Reminder is an email that is automatically delivered to your inbox when your property's survey has not been updated in 8 or more days. Within our ecosystem, every property's survey should be updated weekly. Property Update Reminder emails are designed to help each of our users maintain these weekly updates via a friendly reminder. 



**Note:** If you have a portfolio of properties assigned to you in Radix, you will receive a *weekly* Property Update Reminder that outlines all of your properties whose surveys have not been updated in 8 or more days. This email is auto-delivered every Wednesday at 8AM (PST).
