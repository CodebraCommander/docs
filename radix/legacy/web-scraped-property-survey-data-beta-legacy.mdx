---

To streamline the collection of real-time survey data, Radix has introduced web-scraped data. Each Monday, ATR and Rent values will automatically pre-populate into the property surveys for competitors on your market survey who are not Benchmark subscribers. This data is obtained from internet listing services (ILS') and property websites. 



**Note:** This feature is currently in beta and our team is actively working on the ability to incorporate additional data points into surveys. Your feedback is invaluable to our ability to provide the best solutions to you, so feel free to reach out at [clientsuccess@radix.com](mailto:clientsuccess@radix.co) with your thoughts. 



#### Identifying Surveys with Web-Scraped Data


When [updating a property survey](kb://article/zendesk:radix:32792982682637) you can easily identify whether web-scraped data has been pre-populated. A banner will appear on the Apartments to Rent and Rent steps notifying you that web-scraped data is present. If this banner is not present, that means no web-scraped data is available for the property.

#### Updating Surveys with Web-Scraped Data


To update a property survey that contains web-scraped data, follow the steps below: 


<Steps>
  <Step title="**Property data:** Enter the property's main metrics like occupancy %, leased %, traffic and net leases per week. You have the ability to add general notes for the property in this step, or steps 2 - 4 as well.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Apartments to rent:** The property's 60 day availability, per floor plan will be pre-populated here.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Rent:** For available floor plans, the lowest rate for a 12-month lease term will be pre-populated here.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Concessions:** In this step, make sure to add concessions when applicable. For an easier process use the built-in concessions calculator to help calculate the value of any one-time or recurring monthly concessions being offered at the property.">

#### Not seeing web-scraped data?


Our web-scraping feature is still in beta and survey data might not be pre-populated for all your competitors. If you don’t see data pre-populated, it means we are still working to scrape the data for that property. At Radix, we're committed to building solutions with your needs in mind. If there are any other data points you find on a property website that you would like to see incorporated into Radix, please send us a message so we can explore capturing those. Along with the data point, tell us a little about why you’d like to see that data point and what it would help you do in your day-to-day efforts.
