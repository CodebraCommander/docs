| ***RealRents v2.2.1 includes an update to how integrations are displayed.***
*If your organization is using this new version, please check the* [*Integrations*](kb://article/zendesk:radix:38096760080397) *article in the **RealRents Help Center**for updated instructions and guidance.* |


 When you need to verify how your imported property survey values have been
 calculated,
 the ***Integration Details*** on your property survey
 will
 offer you a detailed view. You can use this detailed view to:
 


* View what survey values (i.e., Occupancy %, Leased %, ATR, Rents, etc.)
 have
 been imported.
* View how imported survey values were calculated.



**We're Here to Help!** If you feel there is a discrepancy with any of your imported survey values, submit a ticket to our team [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance. 
 



### Accessing Integration Details



 You can access Integration Details for a property by navigating into its
 property
 survey. To view the detailed information on how imported survey data has
 been
 calculated, click the hyperlinked *Integration details* text. 
 

This detailed view is available on steps 1 - 3 of the survey since these steps contain the data points our integration calculates using your property management system's (PMS) data.
