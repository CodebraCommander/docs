Keeping your Property Survey updated ensures it remains visible on [RealRents](kb://article/zendesk:radix:32826267937933), while also enabling you to track performance and make informed decisions based on real-time data. This article provides a guide on how to update your property's survey, which requires a weekly refresh.


### Updating property surveys


Select *Surveys* from the Benchmark dropdown menu found at the top of your screen.

[When to update property surveys?](../realrents/general/understanding-clock-colors)


Click "Update Property" to complete the updates and list your property on RealRents. On the left sidebar, you can see the status of your properties, whether they are listed or unlisted. 



**Note:** If you have a property management system (PMS) integration established, follow the steps outlined in [this article](kb://article/zendesk:radix:27994992281869) to access and update your own property survey. If your property is not PMS integrated visit [this article](kb://article/zendesk:radix:32860114535693).

To ensure your property is listed on RealRents, make sure your survey is kept up to date. Even if PMS integration is in place, it’s important to review and confirm concessions weekly.
