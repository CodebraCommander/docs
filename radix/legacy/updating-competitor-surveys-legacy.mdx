When updating your weekly market survey in Benchmark, your goal is to have updated and quality data for your property *and* each of the competitors you've elected to include on your market survey. In this article, we'll break down how to update your competitor surveys and increase data quality scores as needed.


### Identifying out-of-date competitors


The Competitor updates table on your RealRent page displays three different colored clock icons to help you easily identify when a survey needs to be updated.

* **Green Clock:** Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 7 days.
* **Orange Clock:** Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 8 - 14 days.
* **Red Clock:** Indicates it has been 15+ days since the property's survey was updated.


### Updating out-of-date competitors


Your goal each week is to have every competitor on your market survey display a green clock. When you encounter an orange or red clock, click Update property to access and update the property's survey.

### Increasing data quality scores


A data quality score is given to every property survey that has been updated within the past week. Data quality scores are based on missing values and data anomalies found by our advanced algorithms. 


* If you notice a low data quality score for one of your competitors, you can review and resolve the potential data issues driving the score by clicking *Improve Score.*
