The Concessions Report offers valuable information for those seeking to understand and strategize on a single property's concessions. 


It can be used to help address questions such as:


* What concessions has the property been offering?
* What concessions has a property's competitors been offering?
* What's the average concessions being offered and how does a property compare?
* Are the concessions we're offering being given at the expense of NER?
