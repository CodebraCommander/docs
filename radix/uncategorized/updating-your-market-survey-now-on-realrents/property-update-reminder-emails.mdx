When a property survey hasn't been updated for eight or more days, the system will automatically send you a reminder email titled 'Property Update Reminder'. Within our ecosystem, every property survey should be updated weekly, and these emails are designed to help you maintain that schedule.



**Note:** Note: If a property survey has not been updated in 8 or more days, you will receive a weekly email  **on Tuesdays**  (separate from the initial reminder) indicating how many of your properties are out of date. This email includes an  **"Update Now"**  button that, once clicked, will take you directly to the RealRents page where you can complete your property survey update.  

**To be redirected successfully, you must be signed in to your Radix account.**
