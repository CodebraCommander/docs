title: Managing ProForma Licenses
---

Our *Manage Users* feature gives you the built-in tools needed to effortlessly manage the ProForma licenses your organization has purchased. You can easily assign and re-assign ProForma licenses as team members join or depart your organization. Read on to learn more about how to identify who has a ProForma license, and how to manage the licenses you have.



**Note:** A *Corporate Manager* user role is required in order to manage licenses for your users. Some or all of the features discussed in this article will be unavailable to you if you do not have this role type. 
#### Identifying ProForma Users


You can determine which users do and do not have access to ProForma by using features found on the Manage Users page. To navigate to this page, select Manage Users from the drop-down menu located in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.

Once the Manage Users page appears, use the *Columns* and *Filters* options to refine the list of users down to only those who have ProForma access. 


* **Columns:** Select *Products* from this menu to include a column that outlines which products each user has access to.
* **Filters:** If you have a large number of users, you can use the filters menu to further refine the list of users down to only those with ProForma access.

**Pro Tip:** If you need to export the list of users shown, you can do so by clicking the Export Data feature located directly to the right of the Filters menu. 



#### Assigning ProForma Access


To issue a user a ProForma license, follow the steps outlined below. Once access has been enabled for the user, they will automatically receive access to ProForma and its capabilities upon their next login. 


* Click the three vertical dots located to the right of the user's name, then select Edit User from the menu that appears.

The number of licenses your organization has available for distribution will be outlined to the right of the toggle option. If you have reached your organization's license limit, you can purchase additional licenses, or remove a license from another user who no longer needs it. 


#### Removing ProForma Access


There may be times you need to remove a user's ProForma license. Doing so will remove their access to the ProForma product, but will not remove their ability to login to Radix if you have additional Radix products. To disable ProForma for a specific user:


* Click the three vertical dots located to the right of the user's name, then select Edit User from the menu that appears.

* Navigate to the Product Permissions section of the page that appears, then toggle the Radix ProForma option off and click save.
