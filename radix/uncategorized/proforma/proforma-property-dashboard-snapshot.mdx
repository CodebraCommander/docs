ProForma provides you with a variety of built-in tools to streamline the underwriting process and more efficiently evaluate your custom property. The Snapshot portion of your custom property's dashboard is one such tool. 


Snapshot helps you strategically position your property within a comp set by allowing you to see where your property would rank across different metrics.

Read on to learn more about how to customize the data you see. 


#### Customizing Your Property Snapshot


When you click on any of the metrics (i.e., NER, Concessions, Occupancy %, Traffic, etc.) outlined, Snapshot will auto-rank your properties and its' competitors accordingly. 


**Preferences**


* You can customize the metrics displayed on Snapshot by using the *Preferences* settings gear. Simply select the metrics you want to include, then click *Update*. ![Customize_Snapshot.png](/images/radix/6c98bc0d3d7ead5d734ea749cbd60df17c6c8e39.png)


**More Details**


* Click the *More Details* option at the bottom of the Snapshot table to view applicable metrics at the unit level. Use the Ops Metrics section to view competitor averages benchmarked against your property.![Floor_Plans_and_Ops_Metrics.png](/images/radix/6b6e22b17173baab4226242d6d98e330ac25fdfa.png)


**Perspectives**


* The *Perspectives* feature allows you to exclude specific floor plans, unit types, and properties from your analysis. For example, if you want to see how your custom property ranks when factoring in renovated units only, applying a perspective would allow you to do so.
* To apply a perspective, select one you've already created from the Perspectives menu.  ![Adding_Perspective.png](/images/radix/4b7575f94c35a19343e50de2ac2154f2d2926b74.png)
