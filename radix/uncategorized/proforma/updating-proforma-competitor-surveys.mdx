When you need to update a competitor's property survey, ProForma provides multiple ways to do so. You can:


* **Refresh the Property Survey:** Use the Refresh feature to pull in the property's most recently published survey data from Benchmark.
* **Create a New Property Survey:** Use the New Property Survey feature to add the property's survey data yourself.


Prior to updating the property survey, use the Competitors portion of your ProForma Dashboard to see when the property survey was last updated. 


#### Understanding Clock Colors


Clock icons located to the right of each competitor's name help pinpoint when the last survey was completed for the property. Hover over the clock to see the exact date the last property survey was completed. 


* A **green** clock means the property survey was updated within the past 7 days.
* An **orange** clock means the property survey was updated within the past 8 - 14 days.
* A **red** clock means the property survey was updated in 15+ days.

If you are in need of more recent survey data for a property, use one of the options below to obtain it. 


### Refreshing Property Survey Data


Using the Refresh feature will pull in the property's most recent property survey data for you to use.


Warning: By refreshing the property, you will lose any changes or customizations you've made to the property. Only use this option if you're okay with re-setting the property back to its' original state. 


To refresh a property's survey data:


**Step 1:**


* Click the refresh icon on the Competitors portion of your dashboard.

### Creating a New Property Survey


Alternatively, you can update the property's survey data by creating a new property survey. This will allow you to enter the property's survey data directly into ProForma.


To create a new property survey:


**Step 1:** 


* Use the Competitors portion of your dashboard to locate the competitor whose property survey you want to update. Click the three vertical dots to the right of the competitor's name, and select *New Property Survey* from the menu.

**Step 2:** 


* A new window will appear with contact information for the property located at the top. Use this window to enter details for the property such as Occupancy%, Leased%, Traffic per Week, etc.

* For a true apples-to-apples comparison, keep the following in mind when entering data for the following areas:  

	+ **Apts to Rent:** This field is a sum of the units available to rent within the next 60 days. Enter this data per floor plan under the Floor Plan Information section. This field auto-populates the sum of the apartments to rent you've entered.
	+ **Rent:** Enter the best rate for a 12 month lease here, excluding concessions.
	+ **One-Time & Monthly Concessions:** Use the Concessions Calculator to auto-calculate the value of one-time and monthly concessions. It also allows you to apply concessions to multiple floor plans at once.
* Click *Save Property Survey* to update the property with your changes.


**Step 3:**


* From the Competitors portion of the dashboard, the clock next to the property's name will be green, indicating your changes have been saved.
