Amenities can change and be updated over time. Within Radix, amenities can be edited so each property's information stays up to date. Amenity types in Radix include unit, community, and location amenities. In this article, we'll guide you through how to edit each of these amenity types as needed. 





### Accessing Manage Properties


Everything you need to edit a property's amenities can be found in Manage Properties. To access this page:


* Click the profile icon located in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. Then select *Manage Properties* from the drop-down menu.
