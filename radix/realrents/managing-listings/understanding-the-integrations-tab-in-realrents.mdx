The **Integrations** section gives you visibility into how your leasing and performance data is pulled into RealRents.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each section shows:

**Occupancy % Breakdown** â€“ shows the total number of occupied units at your property, with detailed statuses including:Â 

* Occupied â€“ No Notice
* Occupied â€“ Notice â€“ Rented
* Occupied â€“ Notice â€“ UnrentedÂ   
It also provides the overall occupancy percentage.
