A *shared competitor* is any property on your market survey that another Radix subscriber also includes as a competitor on their market survey. Sharing competitors with other subscribers can help you streamline the collection of market survey data. How?

Within our platform, only one of each property can exist; when a shared competitor's property survey has been updated by another subscriber, the survey is automatically up to date for you as well. 

**Identifying Shared Competitors**

You can easily identify shared competitors on your market survey by navigating to the Competitors table on your Radix Analytics and RealRents page. 

![shared comps benchmark.png](/images/radix/cb730fc89f005d5f38f6e35a925ecca750557c34.png)Shared competitors will display a share icon to the right of the property's name. Hover over the share icon to see a list of additional Radix subscribers who also include the property as a competitor on their market survey.

**Pro Tip:** You can still update a property's survey and improve its score, even if the property's survey was recently updated by a shared competitor. Simply click Update Property in the far-right column of Competitor Updates or click Improve Data Quality. For more details on how to update competitors survey, visit: [Updating Competitor Surveys](kb://article/zendesk:radix:37874525132941)
