RealRents is a revolutionary apartment search engine which brings transparency to consumers on true rent prices, concessions, availability, fees and deposits. By making this data public first, operators can continue to confidently use this information to make the best operational decisions while also benefitting from free, high-quality prospect leads.

RealRents is the next-generation apartment search platform. It understands what users are looking for and presents the data directly from your own property updates to the consumer.

**Accessing RealRents**

To access RealRents, click Surveys on the Benchmark dropdown menu or click Manage Listings on RealRents in the top-right Settings dropdown. You can also use: [https://realrents.com/manage-listings.](https://realrents.com/manage-listings)

**Property Landing Page**

Use your existing Radix credentials to log in to RealRents. Once you log in you will see RealRents property landing page.

![left side.PNG](/images/radix/84d787856f504765a6f3bd6a42d297bf2ddb39cb.png)If you manage multiple properties, the left sidebar displays all properties in your portfolio.

Next to your property name, you'll see an indicator showing how up-to-date the information is. Below the property name, you can view details such as the address, website, management, construction type, and building specifics.

 

![right side.PNG](/images/radix/f2fc90081e6a4ca07a3a6e2287d680ef63e6dc2e.png)On the right side, you'll find the [data quality score](data-quality-score-explained), which is given to every property survey updated within the past week. This score reflects transparency and data reliability, assuring other users that your property’s data is current, well-maintained and trustworthy.

Just above the data quality score, you can check whether your property is [verified](kb://article/zendesk:radix:38333220457229). Verification depends on two conditions:

1. Your concessions have been updated within the last 7 days.
2. Your fees and deposits have been confirmed within the last 90 days.

By updating your listings weekly, you help your property meet transparency benchmarks, and verified listings appear prominently on RealRents and are prioritized in search results.

 

![three dots.PNG](/images/radix/cc5f6278799ab90967dc6496fd4426b2abb8a845.png)Lastly, in the top-right corner, click [Managing Listings](../managing-listings/managing-listings-overview) to manage your property’s information, edit photos and amenities, update concessions and fees and deposits or view integrations.

If your property is not verified, you'll see an additional *Update Property* button, where you can complete your weekly survey.

Clicking the three dots in the top-right corner gives you more options:

* View listing on RealRents - see your property from a consumer’s perspective.
* View property on Radix Analytics - access the property profile on Radix Analytics.

 

**Competitor Updates Table**

Below is the **Competitor Updates** table, which features three [colored clock icons](understanding-clock-colors) to help you quickly identify when a survey needs updating. Under each clock icon, you’ll see the source of the data—whether it was web scraped, integrated, or user-generated. If you want to manually [update your competitors](updating-competitor-surveys) data, click *Update Property*.

If the comps data has already been updated but you want to improve the data quality score, click *Improve data quality.*

![colored clocks.PNG](/images/radix/82544e503935747932f4e9ade7950b8f622b1130.png)Use the three dots menu to visit the property profile on Radix Analytics.

 

**Best Practices**

* Update concessions within the last 7 days.
* Confirm fees and deposits within the last 90 days
* Maintain your property’s information, photos and amenities
* Regularly review and update competitor surveys or click Improve Data Quality when needed.
