The embedded RealRents allows you to display real-time, transparent pricing — including all mandatory fees, deposits, and concessions — directly on your property website.

By adding a single line of code, renters visiting your site will see up-to-date total pricing for any unit or floorplan without leaving your website. This ensures compliance with transparency regulations, improves renter trust, and can lead to higher conversions. 

 

### What You’ll Need Before You Begin

To successfully embed RealRents, make sure you have:

* An **active RealRents integration** (your property data must be syncing).
* **All fees, deposits, and concessions entered and kept updated** in RealRents.
* **An API key** provided by Radix (unique for your property).

Note: Contact your Client Success Manager if you have not yet received your API key. 

 

### Step-by-Step Guide to Embed

#### Step 1: Add the Script

Include the RealRents embed script inside the <head> section of your website:



|  |
| --- |
| <script src="https://embed.realrents.com/realrents-embed.js" data-api-key="YOUR\_API\_KEY"></script> |

Replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with the **API key provided by Radix.**

 

#### Step 2: Choose What You Want to Display

You can display **all units**, **a specific floorplan**, or a **specific unit.**

  
**Option A: Display All Units**



|  |
| --- |
| <real-rents></real-rents> |

  
**Option B: Display a Specific Floorplan**



|  |
| --- |
| <real-rents floorplan-id="FLOORPLAN\_ID"></real-rents> |

  
**Option C: Display a Specific Unit**



|  |
| --- |
| <real-rents unit-id="UNIT\_ID"></real-rents> |

 

* FLOORPLAN\_ID = The unique ID of the floorplan in your Property Management System (PMS).
* UNIT\_ID = The unique ID of the unit in your PMS.

If no ID is provided, the widget will display all units at your property.

If you only want to show a **price card** (instead of the full table):



|  |
| --- |
| <real-rents-price unit-id="UNIT\_ID" type="starting"></real-rents-price> |

Attributes:

* UNIT\_ID or FLOORPLAN\_ID (required)
* type (optional: starting or range, default is starting)

* Place the calculator **wherever you want the pricing to appear** (e.g., next to your “Apply Now” button).
* You can use **multiple instances** of the widget on the same page.
* Always ensure your **fees and deposits are current in RealRents** — this keeps your website pricing accurate.
* After embedding, **test across desktop and mobile** to confirm proper display.

 

### Troubleshooting & Support

If the widget does not display correctly, check:

* The **API key** is correct and active.
* The unit/floorplan IDs match your PMS.
* The script is correctly placed inside the <head> tag.
