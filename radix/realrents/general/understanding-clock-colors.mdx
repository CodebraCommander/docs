title: Understanding Clock Colors
---

When you're benchmarking your property's performance against others, it's crucial to understand how recent the data you're analyzing is. This is why you'll often see different colored clocks throughout our Radix products. These clocks exist to help you understand how up to date the survey data you're using is.

**What do Clock Colors Represent?**

To ensure your decision-making is fueled with the latest data, Radix promotes weekly property survey updates. Whether a property survey has received its weekly update is the driving factor behind the clock colors you see.

There are three (3) different clock colors you can encounter when working within Radix:

 Indicates that the property's survey was updated within the last 7 days.
* **Orange Clock:**
 Indicates that the property's survey was updated within the last 8 - 14 days.
* **Red Clock:** Indicates
 that it has been 15+ days since the property's survey was updated.

If you see a red or orange clock next to one of your competitors or your own property and want to update it manually, click on [Update Property](updating-competitor-surveys).  
Just below the clock, you’ll see the source of the data — whether it’s user-generated, web-scraped, or integrated.

The competitor table in Benchmark helps you quickly identify surveys that need updates using easy-to-spot colored clocks. To make changes, simply hover over a clock and click **Update on RealRents** to refresh the survey, or **Improve on RealRents** to enhance the property's [data quality score](data-quality-score-explained).

You’ll be redirected to the RealRents login page, and once logged in, you can update the data for all properties in your portfolio. Any changes you make in RealRents will automatically reflect in Radix Analytics.
