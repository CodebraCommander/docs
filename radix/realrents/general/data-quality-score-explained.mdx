title: Data Quality Score Explained
---

In RealRents, every up-to-date property survey receives a **Data Quality Score**. This score appears at the end of each survey and helps you assess how complete, consistent, and reliable the data is—whether it's for your own property or your competitors. It also includes guidance to help you improve your score.

Maintaining a high Data Quality Score is essential. It ensures transparency across the shared ecosystem and strengthens your property's credibility with other users who rely on the data you provide.

**Why a High Score Matters**

A high Data Quality Score reflects **transparency and data reliability**. It assures other users that your property’s data is current, thoughtfully maintained, and trustworthy. In turn, this builds **credibility** for your team and strengthens the entire shared ecosystem.

**How Data Quality Scores Are Calculated**

Our advanced algorithms assign a score to each survey based on three key factors:

* **Missing data values**: Points are deducted if fields like occupancy %, leased %, traffic, or ATR are left blank.
* **Repeated data values**: If the same values are carried over week after week without change (e.g., ATR never updates), your score may drop.
* **Data anomalies**: Unusual spikes or drops—for example, a sudden 20% drop in occupancy—may lower your score.

**Where to Find Data Quality Scores**

* **Your Property**: When you log in to RealRents, the data quality score will be shown on the right side of the page.

The **Enhancement opportunities** column shows you which metrics you need to resolve to get a 100% data quality score.
