Radix Research's Market Snapshot offers insights into how key operational metrics (i.e., traffic, leases, ATR, concessions, etc.) are faring at the national, state, MSA, and submarket levels. These insights can be leveraged not only to see how different locales are performing, but to understand:


* Which submarkets within an MSA are performing the best across different metrics.
* Quickly see how metrics have changed over different time frames.
* How your portfolio or property compares to the submarket average.
