### Adding Competitors to Your ProForma Property




**CompMatch (Recommended Comps)**

When CompMatch has recommended properties for you to consider, you can easily access and review these recommendations directly from your custom property's Competitors Dashboard.


**Step 1:** Simply click the building icon located on the Competitors Dashboard. The number of recommendations you have will be displayed in blue directly above this icon.

**Step 3:** Use the similarity score to help determine whether you'd like to accept or ignore the recommendation. When interacting with this feature, you'll find recommendations broken into three categories.

<Steps>
  <Step title="**Recommended Comps:** Displays any new recommendations pending your review. You can either accept or ignore the recommendation.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Considering You as a Comp:** Outlines recommended properties that consider your property to be a comp, but have not been added to your comp set yet.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Ignored Comps:** Shows previous recommendations that were ignored. Clicking the (+) icon to the left of the property's name will give you the ability to see why the property was ignored.">
  </Step>
</Steps>


**Step 4**: Use the checkboxes to the left of the property's name to ***Accept*** the recommendation. Once you've selected each of the recommendations you want to add, click *Add Comps.* Use the ***Ignore*** button to the right of the property's similarity score to ignore the recommendation. Clicking ignore will prompt you to enter a reason for ignoring the recommendation.

**Add Comps from a Map**
Any known properties within our ecosystem are plotted out on an interactive map within ProForma for you.
**Step 1:** To access the map, simply click the building icon located on your custom property's Competitors Dashboard. ![CompMatch Competitors Table.png](/images/radix/da66af4432987da38c8f30cbcaadfebd3c74c032.png) **Step 2:** A new window will appear with an interactive map located to the right of the window. Your custom property is denoted on the map by the Radix X. Additional multifamily properties in the area are denoted with a plus (+) symbol to indicate the option to add the property. To add a property, simply click the plus (+) symbol.  ![Plus Symbol Add Comp.png](/images/radix/c47e967cc8f47ee157a0b13e62fae934c51856bd.png) **Step 3:** Once you've clicked the plus (+) symbol, the property will appear on the List of Comps for the Property on the left side of the window. A similarity score will be outlined next to the property's name, indicating how similar the property is to your custom property. Click [here](../Benchmark/managing-properties/compmatch-recommended-comps.mdx) to learn more about how the similarity score is calculated. ![](/images/radix/c136dea20df8f50338831d30b42966dcde26818c.png) **Step 4:** Once you've included each of the properties you want to add as a comp, click Save Comps. ![Save Comps.png](/images/radix/c740bb9626c8c94695e239fca825031c7069bda8.png)





**Search Comps by Name or Address**
You can directly search for a property by name or by address if you have that information readily available.
**Step 1:** To access the search bar, simply click the building icon located on your custom property's Competitors Dashboard. ![CompMatch Competitors Table.png](/images/radix/da66af4432987da38c8f30cbcaadfebd3c74c032.png) **Step 2:** A new window will appear. Use the search bar located below the map to search properties by name or by address. ![Search properties.png](/images/radix/1bad2cd886222c6de785a71743a452fb3905f18c.png) **Step 3:** Once you've located the property you've searched for, click its name and it will be added to the *List of Comps for This Property* section of the window. A similarity score will be displayed to the right of the property's name indicating how similar it is to your custom property.
