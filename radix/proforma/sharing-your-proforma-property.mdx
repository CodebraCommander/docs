---

Each of the custom ProForma properties you create is private and only accessible to you. However, there may be times you want to share your custom property with others within your organization. Based on the permission level you choose, others will be able to edit or view the custom property you have created in ProForma.


To share a ProForma property you will need to:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the property you wish to share.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the user(s) you want to share the property with.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant users with view or edit permissions for the property.">
  </Step>
</Steps>


#### Step 1: Select and Share the Property


* Within ProForma, navigate to the specific property you want to share.
* From the *Competitors* portion of the custom property's dashboard, click the vertical ellipses to the right of the property's name. ![Click_Vertical_Ellipses.png](/images/radix/04d09f25cfcafffaba182aa24eca17228e72ed23.png)


* A menu will appear. Select the *Share* option from the menu.![Select_Share.png](/images/radix/f9181a58842c0b9cb1c61b5ab91b94b85d56837d.png)


#### Step 2: Choose User(s) to Share the Property With


* Use the *Available Users* menu that appears to select the users you want to share your property with. You can select from the users shown, or search for users using the search bar![Select_Users.png](/images/radix/c0f226ab75389fcfd7c4d7477795c440d80d6242.png)



**Pro Tip:** You can share your ProForma property with Benchmark users! If there are users within your organization who use Benchmark, but do not have access to ProForma, you can still select them from this menu and share your custom property with them. A popular use case for sharing a ProForma property with a Benchmark user is when you're looking to have the user update a competitor's property survey for you.



#### Step 3: Grant Users View or Edit Permissions


* Once you have selected the users you will share your property with, use the menu to the right of their name to choose whether they'll receive view or edit permissions.
	+ **View permissions** will give the user access to view the property and pull reports associated with the property.
	+ **Edit permissions** will give the user access to make edits to the property.
* Click *Save* to update your changes, and share the property with the users you've selected.![Grant_Permissions.png](/images/radix/5f54c38f7245ddc8cbc34cf86d5e9a4ebaaeacf2.png)
