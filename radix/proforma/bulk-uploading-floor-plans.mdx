title: Bulk Uploading Floor Plans
---

While you can add floor plans to your ProForma property individually, you also have the option to upload multiple floor plans at once. This may be a more efficient option in scenarios where you have a large quantity of floor plans to add, or when you have multiple versions of the same floor plan to add. 


#### Bulk Uploading Your Floor Plans


To bulk upload your floor plans, follow the steps outlined below. 


**Step 1:** 


Locate the property you want to upload floor plans for.


* Each of your ProForma properties can be accessed from the banner on the left side of your ProForma dashboard.
* Search for a ProForma property by name, or select it from the displayed list of options.

**Step 2:**
