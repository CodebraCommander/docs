Keeping your competitor surveys accurate and up to date is essential for reliable market insights. To ensure data transparency and integrity, you may occasionally encounter a “locked” property in your Competitors Table. Here’s what that means—and what to do next.

**What Is a Locked Property?**

A *locked property* is a competitor listing that displays a lock icon next to its name in the Competitors Table. This indicates the property is currently **protected from external updates**.

**Why Are Some Competitor Properties Locked?**

Properties that use **Radix** are considered data owners. To maintain transparency and ensure the most accurate data comes directly from the source, these properties are **locked for 14 days** following their last update.

This approach promotes trust and data quality by giving Radix subscribers a fair window to update their own surveys before others are allowed to step in.

 

**When Will a Locked Property Be Unlocked?**

If a Radix property hasn’t been updated within **15 days**, it will automatically unlock. At that point, the property can be updated by other users who have it listed as a competitor. See: [Updating Competitor Surveys](kb://article/zendesk:radix:37874525132941)

This system helps balance data ownership with collective visibility — encouraging timely updates while ensuring your market data remains as complete and current as possible.
