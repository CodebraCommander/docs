Radix currently offers integrations with the top Property Management System (PMS) providers in multifamily. When you establish an integration between Radix and your PMS, you can make weekly property survey updates more efficient for your teams. Via our integration, your weekly property surveys will be auto-updated with values calculated from data points imported from your property management system.Â 


#### Integration Benefits


* **Increased Data Entry Efficiencies:** Rather than manually entering all the data needed to update their weekly property survey, our integrations pull the majority of the data needed directly from your PMS. Your teams will simply need to enter any monetary concessions and general notes they want to reflect on their survey.
* **Increased Data Accuracy:**By pulling crucial data points directly from your PMS, you'll minimize errors associated with manual data entry.
* **Increased Data Consistency:** Our integrations logic standardizes the calculation of key metrics like Occupancy %, Apartments to Rent (ATR), Rent, etc. to give you the apples-to-apples comparisons needed for accurate benchmarking.


#### Supported Property Management Systems


* Yardi Voyager
* Entrata
* OneSite
* ResMan
