The roles, permissions, and levels of access you want associated with an individual can change over time. That's why we give you the tools you need to keep your team's access up to date within Radix. When you need to make an edit to a user, the tools you need are located within the Manage Users section of Radix. 


### Accessing Manage Users


To navigate to the Manage Users section of Radix, click the profile icon found in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, then select *Manage Users.*
