Benchmark is designed to act as a single source of truth for everyone invested in the success of a property. That's why we've made it easy for you to add new Benchmark users, control the level of access they have to a property's data, and get started collaborating, quicker. 



**Please note:** The information contained within this article is relevant to the addition of new Benchmark users. When your account is created on Benchmark you will be granted with access to [RealRents](kb://article/zendesk:radix:32826267937933) as well with the same credentials. If you want to add a new property to Benchmark, follow the steps outlined [here.](kb://article/zendesk:radix:15701448848269) If you want to grant someone access to Proforma, learn more [here.](kb://article/zendesk:radix:18309785128845)



### Understanding User Roles & Permissions


There are four (4) different types of users roles you can add in Benchmark. These roles impact the permission levels of a user. Depending on your own user role, the type of users you can add to the system may be limited. 




| User Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| Property Owner | Cannot add Benchmark users. This role only has access to view properties they have been assigned within Benchmark.  |
| Corporate Manager | Can add any user type within Benchmark. This role will also provide the user with access to view and edit all of the properties within your organization's Benchmark account.  |
| Regional Manager | Can only add Regional Manager and Property Manager users within Benchmark. This role will only be able to view and edit properties that have been assigned to them within Benchmark.  |
| Property Manager | Can only add Property Manager and Property Owner users within Benchmark. This role only has access to view and edit a single property that has been assigned to them within Benchmark.  |
