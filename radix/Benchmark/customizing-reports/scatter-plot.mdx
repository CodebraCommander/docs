Our Scatter Plot feature is a customizable graph you can add to your Market Survey Summary report to help you spot opportunities to optimize your floor plan rents.


### What is the Scatter Plot?


The Scatter Plot graph helps you explore the relationship between a floor plan's square footage and the rent the floor plan is achieving. Every floor plan for your property and each of your comps is plotted out on the graph. 


By visualizing every floor plan in this way, you can compare rent values for similar-sized floor plans, identify rent deltas between similar-sized floor plans, and determine whether there's an opportunity to optimize rents.

**Pro Tip**: If you want to export the Market Survey Summary Report with the Scatter Plot included, export the report via PDF. The Scatter Plot graph is not supported within Excel files.

There are several ways you can customize your Scatter Plot graph to better suit your needs.

* **Vertical Axis:** Select whether you want Rent or NER values displayed on the vertical axis of the graph.
* **Floor Plans:** Use this menu to select whether you want to have all floor plans plotted out on the graph, or whether you want to refine your analysis by floor plan type (i.e. studios, one bedrooms, etc.).
* **Show Trends Line:** Choose whether you want trend lines displayed on the graph. When displayed, you'll have a trend line representing your property and a trend line representing the average slope for each of your comps.
