title: Standardizing Reporting With an Organization Template
---

If you're looking to create consistent, standardized reporting, be sure to leverage the Organization Template feature. Organization Templates allow you to share a template for a specific report with everyone in your organization. 



**Note:** Sharing a template means you are sharing the way data is viewed. You are not sharing the data itself. Organization Templates will include report settings and preferences you've customized. Only data for the properties a user has access to will be available when they go to use the template. 



To create an Organization Template users can access you'll need to:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Customize report preferences.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the report.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the report as an Organization Template.">
  </Step>
</Steps>


A popular use case for this feature is standardizing the Market Survey Summary Report across a set of properties. We'll walk you through how to create an Organization Template using this use case as an example. 


### Customizing Settings & Preferences


* First, you'll want to locate the report you'd like to create an Organization Template for. In this example, we've selected the Market Survey Summary Report from the Radix Reports menu.

</Frame>


* Now it's time to select the settings and preferences you want to be standardized. In this example, we've used the preferences and date range menu to select the default options we want to be included in our organization template. Click *Run Report* to apply your choices.

### Saving the Report


* Click the save button to give your template a name and save it.

**Pro Tip:** Once you've clicked save, your report will automatically appear under the *My Reports* section of your Reports page. You can use this area to easily see which reports you've saved for personal reuse, and which reports you've shared as an Organization Template. 


### Sharing the Report as an Organization Template


After you've given your template a name, it's time to share it with your organization. 


* Click the share icon - this will open a *Share Template* menu.
