### Managing your Comps


The Manage Comps page outlines the list of comps currently in use for a property, along with an interactive map. Each comp will display a similarity score auto-generated by Radix based on how similar they are to your property. The interactive map will showcase numbered pins to help you visualize where each competitor is located. It will also display all properties within the area with a white pin.


You can have up to 10 comps and have multiple options available to manage the property's comps:
