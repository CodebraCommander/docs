When it comes to benchmarking your property's performance, ensuring your property is being compared to the most relevant competition is critical. You can think of our **CompMatch** feature as your built-in assistant; it continually scopes out the potential competition, surfaces properties you may want to add as a comp, and helps you feel confident you have your eyes on the properties that matter.

### Overview


Not all properties are created equal, and our CompMatch feature uses an advanced algorithm to generate recommendations based on how similar a property is to yours. The following characteristics are used by the algorithm to analyze properties and generate a similarity score for you:


* Construction Type
* Net Effective Rent (NER)
* Number of Units
* Proximity
* Square Footage
* Unit Mix
* Walk Score/Bike Score
* Year Built


Use this similarity score to decide whether you'd like to accept or ignore the recommendation. When interacting with this feature, you'll find recommendations broken into three general categories: 


<Steps>
  <Step title="**Recommended Comps:** Displays any new recommendations pending your review. You can either accept or ignore the recommendation.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Considering You as a Comp:** Outlines recommended properties that consider your property to be a comp, but have not been added to your comp set yet.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="**Ignored Comps:** Shows previous recommendations that were ignored. Clicking the (+) icon to the left of the property's name will give you the ability to see why the property was ignored.">
  </Step>
</Steps>
