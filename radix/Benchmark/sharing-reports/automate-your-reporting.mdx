title: Automate Your Reporting
---

Every report that's available in Radix can be customized and automated to make it easier for you to stay on top of your reporting. When you automate your reporting, you enable your reports to automatically run and deliver to the recipients of your choosing. Follow the simple steps below to get started.  


### Step 1: Customize your report


First, customize your report and save your customizations. Each report is customizable in its own unique way. However, here are a few common menus you'll find to tailor a report to your specific needs:

</Frame>


* **Properties**: Choose the property(s) you want to include in your reporting.
* **Perspectives:** Applying a perspective allows you to further refine the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to include lease-up properties for comparison in your report. Or perhaps you want to exclude certain floor plan types like townhomes. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](kb://article/zendesk:radix:7313516628749)
* **Date Range:**Select one of the provided date range options for your report.
* **Preferences:**The options within this menu vary based on the report you've selected, but the majority of your available customization options will be found here.
	+ Regardless of the options you choose, be sure to click *Update* to save your preferences and *Run Report* to pull the report with those options reflected.


### Step 2: Save your customizations to *My Reports*


After you've customized your report to your liking, click the *Save* button located in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Enter a memorable name for your customized report, then click the secondary save button. Clicking the secondary save button automatically saves your report, and the customizations associated with it, to the *My Reports* page.

### Step 3: Choose your reporting delivery schedule


Your customized report will now be available on the My Reports portion of your Reports page. From this page, you can view general details per report such as when it was last modified, the type of report it is, and the name you've given it.

To choose the delivery schedule you want your report to send on, and the recipients who should receive your report:


* Click the three vertical dots to the right of the report's name.
* Select email from the menu of options.

A new window will appear where you can enter details related to who the report should be delivered to and when. You can even include a custom message to accompany your report for recipients to see.
