The Competitor Summary Report offers a side-by-side comparison of property metrics and information for a subject property and its' selected competitors. In addition to overall property metrics such as Occupancy %, NER, Concessions, etc., the report includes metric comparisons at a floor plan level. 


Use this report anytime you're looking for a clear and visual comparison of metrics and information at a property level.
