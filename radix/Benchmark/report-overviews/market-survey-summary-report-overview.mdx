The Market Survey Summary Report (MSSR) is a robust and highly customizable report commonly used in monthly reporting packages.


Impactful and interactive data visuals make this one of our most popular reports to tell a property's story, understand how a property is performing and determine what opportunities exist to optimize its' performance. 


A mere few questions the report can answer are:


+ Where does the property rank across key metrics like occupancy %, leased %, ATR, and NER?
+ What changes are we seeing across key metrics like traffic, leases, and closing ratios?
+ What are the average concessions being offered by competitors and how does the property compare?


Be sure to share this report in its' entirety, or details from it in advance of operations calls to elevate your conversations and focus on what truly matters. 


### Accessing the Report


To access the report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Market Survey Summary* from the report options.

### Customizing the Report


The Market Survey Summary Report (MSSR) can be customized in numerous ways to allow you to focus on what matters most to you. 


Use the following drop-down menus to begin tailoring the report to your needs.


* **Property:** Search for a property within your portfolio or select the property you want to run the report for.
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to include lease-up properties for comparison in your report. Or perhaps you want to exclude certain floor plan types like townhomes. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](../evaluating-your-portfolio-s-performance/how-to-use-perspectives.mdx)
* **Date Range:** Select from one of the date ranges provided.
* **Preferences:**
	+ **Comps:** Select the competitors you want to include in the report.
	+ The following reports are optional to include in your MSSR. Toggle them on if you want to have them added.
		- Property Profiles
		- Floor Plan Comparison
		- Scatter Plot
		- Fees & Deposits
		- Amenities
		- Concessions


Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.

### Viewing the Report


After the report has been run, the report will update with your customizations displayed. A tab for each report you included from the Preferences menu will appear to the right of the Overview tab. Let's walk through the information you'll find on each tab of the report.
