+ Evaluate how a property's reviews fare in relation to the competitor average.

To further investigate reviews, you can click on the number of reviews outlined next to the star rating. This will take you to the review site referenced. 



**Pro Tip:** Take note of the Comp Averages listed at the bottom of the report. This is the average star rating of all competitors you've selected in the Preferences menu. Are the quantity and rating of your property's reviews higher or lower than the competitor average?
