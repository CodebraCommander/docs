The Floor Plan Comparison Report is a popular powerhouse, beloved by operational and asset management teams for its' multi-faceted functionality. Sort, rank, and analyze a variety of customizable metrics to investigate a property's performance at the floor plan level.


Whether you opt to keep the report high-level, or add metrics for additional layers of analysis, the report can be used to help address impactful questions such as:


* What's the market share of a particular floor plan or unit type?
* How many units of a particular floor plan are available to rent?
* What concessions are being offered, per floor plan?


### Accessing the Report


To access the Floor Plan Comparison Report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Floor Plan Comparison* from the report options.

### Customizing the Report


Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:


* **Property:** Search for a property within your portfolio or select the property you want to run the report for.
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to compare floor plans for lease-up properties in your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](../evaluating-your-portfolio-s-performance/how-to-use-perspectives)
* **Date Range:** Choose from one of the date ranges provided or enter a custom range of your choosing. ![](/images/radix/b29deb236e31820f1f8989d1c2eaedae34464aed.png)


**Preferences:**


* **Comps:** Choose the competitor properties you would like included in the report.
* **Columns:** Select any additional metrics you want to include in the report. What you elect to include will inevitably be determined by your use case. However, ATR, NER vs. Comp Average, One-Time Concessions, and Recurring Concessions are some of the popular options teams appreciate.
* **Show Unit Types:** Toggling this option on allows you to view information by unit type.
* **Show only available units**: Enable this toggle to view data exclusively for available units.

The metrics you've selected from the Preferences menu will be displayed in a table view.


A column to the left will outline the subject and competitor properties you've selected are outlined in rows.

* **Note:** Floor Plan level information will be displayed if you do not have the Show Unit Types option under Preferences toggled on. To view unit type information, make sure to toggle this option on.
