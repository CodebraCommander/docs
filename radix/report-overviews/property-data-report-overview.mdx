With over 40 metrics to choose from, the Property Data Report gives you the ability to build your own report table with any available property data. You can include one or multiple properties in the report, and export it to excel if you want to continue building on it with supplemental data sources.

### Customizing the Report


Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:


* **Properties:** Search for properties within your portfolio or select the properties you want to run the report for from the provided list.
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to exclude non-renovated floor plans from your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](kb://article/zendesk:radix:7313516628749)
* **Preferences:**
	+ **Columns:**What metrics do you want to include in your custom report? Choose the ones you'd like here.
	+ **Column Order:** What order do you want to see your metrics in? Re-arrange the order of your columns here.
	+ **Show Comps/Show Comp Average:** You can toggle the visibility of competitor properties and their averages on or off here.


Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.
