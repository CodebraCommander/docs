Notes

- Values with the same key name can appear in different scopes (for example, `ner` at the subject level vs. within a floor plan or compset). Use Scope to interpret the context.
- Some responses include arrays for unit types; the fields listed under “by unit type” repeat per unit type (e.g., studio, 1BR, 2BR).
