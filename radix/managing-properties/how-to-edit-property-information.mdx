In a dynamic market, properties change frequently.

What type of changes can you make? Common changes you can update include:


* **Property Information:**The property's name, owner, and management company can easily be changed.
* **Amenities:** Unit, community, and location amenities can be updated.
* **Fees & Deposits:**The type and cost associated with fees and deposits can be updated.
* **Floor Plans:**The names, unit mix, square footage, and amenities associated with every floor plan can be updated.
