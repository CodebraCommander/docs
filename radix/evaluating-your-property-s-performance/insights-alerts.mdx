Understanding the supply and demand dynamics your property operates within is key to quickly responding to constantly evolving markets. Our Insights Dashboard surfaces these insights in an easy-to-use dashboard for you and your teams. Interactive visuals, alerts, and performance narratives are designed to make this dashboard your ally in understanding and taking action on your market data. 


### Accessing your Insights Dashboard


Your Insights Dashboard can be accessed directly from your [Property Dashboard](kb://article/zendesk:radix:28865401031949) within Benchmark. From the Property Dashboard, simply click *Insights & Alerts* and you'll be redirected to this feature.

### Insights Dashboard Tools


Once you navigate into your Insights Dashboard, the following tools are readily available to help you understand and take action on your data. 



**A note for lease-ups:** Radix defines a lease-up as any property with an occupancy % lower than 90%. If your property is considered a lease-up, when using this dashboard you'll be prompted to enter your anticipated stabilization date. This date will be used by our algorithms to adjust the insights and assessments for your property. 



#### **Data Quality Assessment**


You'll receive the best insights on this dashboard when your property and your selected comps have up-to-date, quality data. With that in mind, this tool offers an overall assessment of the [Data Quality](kb://article/zendesk:radix:28429466699533) for your property and your comps. Built-in functionality allows you to update surveys and improve data quality scores directly from this tool. ![Screenshot 2024-09-24 160259.png](/images/radix/9bc2550bafada8a73fbba7c5611073ac031fe887.png)


#### **Weekly Alerts**


This tool will alert you of any meaningful changes to your comps performance. You can view all alerts at once, or view them individually by using the metric filters. ![Screenshot 2024-09-24 160659.png](/images/radix/5e1b1706155478cc77807a1697ed68c143a79f16.png)


#### **Leading Indicators**


Understanding the supply and demand dynamics a property is operating within is key to proactively safeguard healthy ATR levels. The tools and visuals within this section are designed to give you:


* **Supply/demand trends -** Easily see what current performance is, how performance has trended over the past 30 days, and whether that performance is considered strong, fair, or weak.
* **Supply/demand insights -** Use the *+Show Insights* options to view detailed narratives on  supply and demand trends for your property and comps.
* **Supply/demand benchmarks -** With a distinct column for your property and your comps, you can easily compare how your property's supply and demand indicators fare in relation to your comps.

#### **Current Performance**


Viewing supply and demand indicators alone won't give you a complete picture of performance data to take action on. That's why this tool offers more context with additional key metrics for you to review and benchmark. Use this area of your Insights Dashboard to:


* **Review trends -** Easily see what current performance is for occupancy, NER, and [RevPau](kb://article/zendesk:radix:20068521632653). Then use the percent change values to see how performance has changed over the past 30 days.
* **Benchmark performance -** With a distinct column for your property and your comps, you can easily evaluate how your property's performance compares to your comps.
