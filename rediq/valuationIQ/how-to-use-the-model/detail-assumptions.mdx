Detail assumptions displays more granular monthly and annual assumptions. This function will appear in the model to the right of the default sections. Detailed assumptions are optional, but may contain fields of information that can  help more accurately forecast your projections.


If a user can’t find a place to input a certain assumption, check Detailed Assumptions, as there's a chance it's contained within.


 On the bottom tab, click on **INPUT TABS ==> Input**


 Then click **Show Detailed Assumptions** on redIQ ribbon
