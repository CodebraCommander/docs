**Overview - Bridge Loan and Future Value Refinance Sizers**
============================================================


valuationIQ now features an option to automatically calculate a bridge loan and/or refinance with built-in sizers. This new enhancement provides a simple, yet powerful way to size this debt directly in the model.


To use this feature, click the button on the redIQ ribbon with the calculator icon labeled “Advanced Loan Calcs”, which can be found in the model settings section.

Once you have clicked the button to add these sizers you will get a pop-up to confirm that they were successfully added.


To then see this in the model, ensure that the “Show Detail Assumptions” button has been clicked.

Next, you can navigate to the Debt Assumptions section on the “Input” page. The new bridge and refinance sizers will appear in this section right next to the loan inputs for clear visibility.
