title: Customize Model Colors
---

redIQ users have the option to customize the color scheme of the model. This can be done either at the account or the deal level. The process is simple:


Corporate admins can set the default account model export colors to reflect their company’s unique brand:


* Users can go to Edit Account and select Customize Colors under the Valuation Model subheading
* Colors can be selected for header font, background font, subheader font, and sensitivity table highlights
* After colors are customized users can easily return to the redIQ color defaults


Any model user can set colors at the deal level:


* Choose **Generate Model** and then click **Customize Colors**
* Colors saved at the deal level are saved for future models generated for that deal
* Colors can be easily previewed to ensure they are correct before export and easily restored to the account defaults
