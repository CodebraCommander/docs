Users can combine multiple deals through redIQ to aggregate a portfolio into one model.


First, create an individual deal for each of the properties, then upload rent rolls and Historicals for each property.


 Click on the "Comps" section on the top of the page.

Select each deal you want to roll up. By clicking “aggregate” on the top of the header, redIQ will roll up the Historicals, into a single deal of these aggregated financials. Then you can export the aggregated Historicals to Excel.

 Next, the user do the same thing for rent rolls. **Make sure the same deals are selected and then roll up the rent rolls.**

After exporting this as well, the rolled up rent rolls and aggregated Historicals that the user downloaded can be uploaded as the source documents for a new deal. This new deal represents the portfolio.
