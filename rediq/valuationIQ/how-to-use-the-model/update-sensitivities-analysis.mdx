#### 
Please Note


If the file is not responding or the sensitivity tables are not updating correctly, there could be too many files open in Excel. Running the sensitivity tables in the redIQ model uses a lot of computing power and if there are several other Excel files open it could prevent the file from updating. To fix the issue, save the file, shut down all of Excel, then open only the model to see if it updates correctly. If the issue persists, please contact [support@rediq.com](mailto:support@rediq.com).
