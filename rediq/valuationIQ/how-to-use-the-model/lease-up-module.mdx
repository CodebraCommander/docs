For users looking to model lease-up deals, redIQ has created the ***valuationIQ Lease-up Module*** to implement into your model. With redIQ’s lease-up module, you can accurately model vacancy on a monthly level until stabilization. Not only does this enable more granularity, using a more realistic leasing velocity can also significantly impact the proforma NOI. Users can utilize this module to help with forecasting the cash flows more accurately and understanding when the property will reach stabilization.


**How to use the Module**  
Users need to download the Module [here](https://bit.ly/3vMsMgp) to start working with the module.

2) Export Rent Roll/Copy/Paste method (valuationIQ-only).

**Important Notes to mention**


There are also other tools and options to enhance or shape the data within the Lease Up Module that are highlighted below.  
On the Lease Up tab in the top left of the page, users can see the Market Rent Growth Rate by Year, Growth Type, and the Input: Minimum Annual Vacancy box. The Market Rent Growth Rate and the Growth Type are directly taken from the data on the Input tab. Below are some screenshot helpers to show where this data is coming from and how it can be edited.

The Lease Up page is also host to the Projection Type drop down, the Units list, and the Units Occupied @ Close chart to shape your data.  
The Units chart shows all the Units input from the file and will highlight the Remaining row if there are any units that have been unaccounted for. The Select Projection Type button allows users to choose the options from the drop down to customize the data as much as the user would prefer. To the right of the Projection Type column, there is a table that shows Units Occupied @ Close over monthly periods and also provides a Cumulative Lease Up %. Users can and may sometimes need to manually enter in data in the table to complete the lease-up schedule.
