title: Blocked Macros in valuationIQ Model
---

Much of the powerful functionality in valuationIQ is enabled by VBA, a programming language that uses macros. These are custom functions that streamline and extend the model’s features.


Depending on your organization’s settings, macros may be blocked from running when opening the model.


This setting can be changed as part of the Trust Center settings within Excel. If the directory in which the model is being opened is a trusted location, this will remove the need to unblock macros on an ad-hoc basis in file properties. While enabling macro permission to a root directory can skirt this issue, enabling access for only a single, immediate parent folder would be necessary for macros to run.


The following steps outline the process for adding a trust location:
