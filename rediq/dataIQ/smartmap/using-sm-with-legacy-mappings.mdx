**How to map subsequent uploads using Legacy Mapping**


If you made any changes to the SM+ mapping and you want to ensure that subsequent uploads are mapped identically, you can utilize the Legacy Mappings option for future OS uploads. This will ensure that all future Operating Statements uploaded into the deal are mapped consistently. The “Override Existing Mappings” option is also compatible with Legacy Mappings; you can first apply Legacy Mappings, and then apply SM+ with the “override” option *turned off* to leverage both the Legacy Mappings and SM+ tool.


When presented with the SmartMap+ dialog box, press ‘Cancel’. Then, in the main ribbon near the top of the page, press the ‘Mappings’ button

Then select "Apply Legacy Mappings"

Next, select the deal and OS upload that you want to use for mapping the current OS upload and press "Apply"

**Option 2: Apply Legacy Mapping from a batch previously uploaded into a different deal**


**1**. To apply Legacy Mapping from a batch that has been uploaded into a different deal than what you’re working in, after pressing the ‘Mappings’ button, select “Apply Legacy Mappings” from the drop-down menu.

**2**. Next, select the deal and OS upload that you want to use for mapping the current operating statement upload and press "Apply"

**How to use SmartMap+ when Legacy Mapping is set as the Default Mapping** **Method**


The default mapping method can be set to either SmartMap+ or Legacy Mapping in the Account settings. The default mapping method will apply to all users associated with the account. The instructions above assume that SmartMap+ has been set as the default mapping method.


If most of the operating statement formats you work with on a regular basis have already been uploaded into a deal and mapped using any mapping method, then you may want to set Legacy Mapping as the default setting for your account. To use SmartMap+ when Legacy Mapping is set as the default, after uploading and submitting the Operating Statement, the Legacy Mappings dialog box will be displayed. At this point, press the "Cancel" button to close that dialog box, then navigate to Mappings > SmartMap+.

From this point, you can now use SmartMap+ to map the uploaded OS as described in the How to upload operating statements utilizing SmartMap+ section.
