## **Overview**

**SmartMap\+** is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of mapping an Operating Statement’s line-item accounts to the [Chart of Accounts](/rediq/dataIQ/operating-statements/chart-of-accounts) (“COA”) as set up in the client’s Account Settings. By using an index and scoring process (rules engine), SmartMap\+ greatly improve this process for our users. Prior to the release of SmartMap\+, users would need to manually map the line-item accounts to their account’s Chart of Accounts the first time an unmapped Operating Statement was uploaded. With SmartMap\+, that process is now automated.

## **What is the in-app experience with SmartMap\+?**

The goal of this feature is to provide users the ability to [upload an Operating Statement](/rediq/dataIQ/operating-statements/automatically-uploading-operating-statements), aka Financial Statement, Historical, or T12) and have the line-item accounts contained in that operating statement automatically mapped to their account’s Chart of Accounts. Now users can upload an operating statement, rely on redIQ to automatically map it in seconds, and move forward with their underwriting process much faster. After the first OS is uploaded in a deal, users can continue to utilize SmartMap\+ or they can use the [Legacy Mapping](/rediq/dataIQ/smartmap/using-sm-with-legacy-mappings) for future Operating Statetment uploads.

SmartMap\+ is most effective when uploading a new operating statement that is in an unfamiliar format (for example, from a seller that you have not worked with previously.) Once you have uploaded the Operating Statement and mapped it using SmartMap\+, all subsequent operating statements that are in that same format can be quickly mapped using Legacy Mapping.
