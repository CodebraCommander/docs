**How to use SmartMap+ to map accounts on existing OS uploads**


Yes, you can use SM+ to re-map accounts on existing OS uploads. While in the deal you wish to re-map, navigate to the Source Data page. Next, select the batch that you want to re-map and then press the "Mappings" button and select ‘SmartMap+’ from the list.


Next, leave the “Override Existing Mappings” box checked in the SmartMap+ dialog box and press "Apply"

This will apply the SmartMap+ account mappings to the existing OS. You can repeat this process for any additional batches in that deal.
