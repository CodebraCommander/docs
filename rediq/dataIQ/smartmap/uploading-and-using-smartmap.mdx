**4**. Once the upload finishes, a new screen will show the data you uploaded. Please check to make sure all the details, like periods and line items, are correct. If everything looks good, click the ‘Submit’ button again, which you'll find at the top-right of the page.

**5**. 5. If this is the first time uploading an operating statement into the deal you will be prompted to select the First Expense Row, the NOI Row, and the NI Row. If the OS you’re uploading only goes to the Net Operating Income (NOI) row, you can leave the default “ ~ No NI ~ “ setting for the NI (Net Income) row.

Once those selections are complete, press the “OK” button to proceed


**6**. You will now be prompted to map the OS line items to the Account’s Chart of Accounts using the following options:


  
**a**. You will be presented with the following dialog box. The first time you upload OS data into a deal, you can select the “Apply” button and the SmartMap+ will analyze and match the accounts on the OS to your account’s COA.

**b**. Override Existing Mappings: this will be checked by default. This will have no effect on SM+ if this is the first time you’ve uploaded an OS into a new deal.  
     - If you are using SM+ to map the line-item accounts after an OS has already been uploaded and mapped (or partially mapped) and you do not want the default SM+ mappings to override what has already been mapped, you will want to deselect this checkbox.


 


**What are the new color codes and icons for?**


After SM+ has completed mapping the line-item accounts, the Source Data page will be displayed. The first column in that view will display the color coded “confidence” icons with green indicating the highest confidence levels (“Matched”), yellow with lower confidence levels (“Needs Review”), and red indicating no confidence or the account was not found (“No Match”.)

After the OS is uploaded and SM+ has mapped the line-item accounts, an “Info” box will be visible near the top-right corner of the page. This dialog box will provide you with the ability to highlight specific accounts based on their status. When you click on any of those status items, the corresponding rows in the OS will be highlighted in yellow (only the first three columns.) For example, by clicking the “Mappings Applied” status, those accounts with the green “Matched” icons will be highlighted.

Clicking the “x Dismiss” at the bottom-right corner of the Info box will remove all yellow highlighting from the rows from the uploaded and mapped operating statement, leaving only the color-coded icons in the  
SmartMap+ column.


 


**How do I review the SM+ account mapping?**


**NOTE**: *SmartMap+ is currently in beta and undergoing thorough testing. It is highly recommended that you review each account for accuracy, regardless of the confidence icon displayed.*


As you are comparing the SM+ mappings to the line items in the uploaded operating statement, you will want to pay particular attention to the “Needs Review” and the “No Match” accounts.


**Needs Review** accounts: there will be two options for these accounts, (1) the mapping is correct, and you can confirm the mapping, or (2) the mapping is incorrect, and you need to revise the mapping.


 


**If the Account Mapping is Correct**  
If the mapping is correct, you can confirm. To do so, hover your curser over the “Needs Review” icon and you will see a “Reviewed” icon appear just to the right of your curser. Click on the “Reviewed” icon to change the “Needs Review” to “Reviewed” in the SmartMap+ column.

If you have a contiguous group of line items that need to be marked as “Reviewed”, you can make bulk changes to those rows rather than changing to “Reviewed” one row at a time. To do so, you can:


1. Select the top row of the range you want to mark as “Reviewed”, then holding the “Shift” key select the last row of the range you want to mark as “Reviewed”. In the example below that will be rows 24 through 33. Note that the selected rows will be highlighted in blue.

2. Next, right click on any cell within the selected range, and from the list of options displayed click on “Mark Selected Row as Reviewed”.

</Frame>


All SmartMap+ mappings in that selected range will now display as “Reviewed”.

**Note:** it is not mandatory to change “Needs Review” to “Reviewed” for SM+ to work. This is primarily for your reference to confirm that you have reviewed the mapping.


**If the Account Mapping is Incorrect**


If the mapping is incorrect, you will need to manually change it. To do this, follow the process outlined in the following section to change or override the SM+ mapping.
