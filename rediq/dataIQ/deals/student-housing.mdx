**Overview**  
In response to the unique demands of the multifamily student housing market, we have developed a specialized tool designed to streamline the management of multiple leases for a single unit. This innovative feature accommodates varying lease start and end dates, as well as different rental rates, providing unparalleled flexibility and efficiency.


Our comprehensive research and analysis of the student housing sector have revealed critical insights into market performance, emerging trends, and potential challenges. These findings underscore the significant opportunity and value that our Student Housing feature offers to student housing investors.  
What is the in-app experience with Student Housing?


**New Deal Creation**  
To add a new Student Housing deal in redIQ, start by clicking on the *+ New Deal* button on the All Deals page.

Note that there is an *Asset Type* dropdown which includes an option for Student Housing and is a **required input**. By selecting Student Housing, this will dynamically change “Units” to “Beds” throughout most of the redIQ application.

Next, input the total number of Beds in the “No. of Beds” input box below the Asset Type. This is an example of where “Units” has changed to “Beds” based on the Asset Type selection. Confirm that the full address is input correctly then press the *Confirm & Add* button to add the deal to your All Deals list.

**Deal Details**  
The Deal Details page has been updated to accommodate the new Student Housing asset type with an *Asset Type* dropdown added just below the Deal Name. This will be prepopulated from the Asset Type dropdown when the deal was added to your account’s All Deals list. However, the Asset Type dropdown on the Deal Details page is also editable, so if there is a pre-existing student housing deal in your account’s All Deals list, the Asset Type can be changed from *Multifamily to Student Housing* in the Deal Details page. This will dynamically change “Units” to “Beds” throughout most of the redIQ application.


In addition to the asset type, a field for noting the university affiliation was added to the Location section of the Deal Details page. This is an **optional** text field where you can input the name of the school where the deal is located. The screenshot below also includes an example of where “Units” has been replaced with “Beds” when the asset type is set to Student Housing.

**Deal Summary**


Modifications to the Deal Summary page have also been made to accommodate student housing. These include adding the *Asset Type and University Affiliation* fields from the Deal Details page as well as revising the Unit Mix to reflect the “*# Beds*” and “*Available Beds*” in place of the conventional # Units and Occupied Units.

**Document Upload**  
After the creation of the deal in redIQ, you can begin the process of uploading documents into the deal. There are no changes to uploading, processing, and analyzing operating statements; however, there is a minor change to the rent roll upload process. After initiating the rent roll upload process, in the first screen you will note two new items:


* #1, now reads “How many total Beds are in the rent roll file being uploaded?” and the input will default to the number of beds from the Deal Details page. This number can be overwritten if needed.
* #2 is a new addition to the page, and simply confirms the Asset Type of the deal.

The other changes you will notice when uploading rent rolls are in *Step 1 – Enter Floor Plan Details* and in *Step 2 – Assign Occupancy Statuses* where columns labeled as “# Units” and Total Units” respectively for conventional deals are now labeled as “# Beds” and “Total Beds”.

**Floor Plan Summary**


Like the changes noted above, areas within the Floor Plan Summary that denoted the number of Units will change to the number of Beds for student housing deals.

**Rent Roll Dashboard**


Due to the nature of student housing operations, many of the graphs contained within the Rent Roll Dashboard will not be applicable. For example, most Lease Types for student housing will be “Market,” so the pie chart will typically reflect 100% of the leases at Market. There will also be little or no Loss to Lease Burn-off, and most leases will expire at the same time at the end of the semester. Note that enhancements to the Rent Roll Dashboard to accommodate Student Housing will be addressed in future versions.

**Rent Roll and Operating Statement Comps**  
For the initial release of the Student Housing feature, we have removed both the *Rent Roll Comps* and *Operating Statement Comps* pages when viewing a student housing deal. This is to prevent combining student housing with conventional deals in the comp list which would lead to inaccuracies in reporting these apples-to-oranges asset types. This will be revised in a future version. Other pages that were removed for similar reasons are the *Sales Comps* and *Market Comp Data (beta)* pages.
