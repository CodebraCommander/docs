### **Settings**


Setting allows changes to deal groupings. A user will be able to search for each deal grouped by category (status, market, date added, etc.).


Within Settings – you can group deals by one specific category and then choose less or more information to view in your deal log’s display columns.


At the bottom of the left side of the screen, click the checkbox to save for next time

### **Filter Deals**


Customizing filters can be use to find specific deals.


Within Filters – you can group deals by several categories, choosing multiple options in each category if needed. Then, toward the upper right, you can Save Filters, this way your deal log only populates information according to your filters.

Consider setting a Filter with only your name, or your immediate team member’s names, listed in Assigned To. This way, when you login, you’ll only see your team’s deal log activity.


You’ll still have access to all of the data within your account; however, a simplified view makes it easier to jump into your workflow.


Lastly, you’ll also notice the Search by Deal Name at the top of the deal log. Whether you have a filter on or not, you can always easily jump to your deal by searching for it by name.


 


### **Export**


Exporting converts the deal log into editable excel sheet.
