title: Pipeline Report
---

The Pipeline Report can be accessed by clicking “Pipeline Report” on the Deals Page. This report splits all deals into "Deals we're working on," and "Deals that have gone Inactive."


**All deals with status:** Active, Bid Placed, or Dormant, will appear in "Deals We’re Working On section."


**All deals with status:** Closed, Passed, Lost, Withdrawn, or Owned Property, will appear in "Deals That Have Gone Inactive section."


When the Status of a Deal is updated, it will appear in the corresponding new section.


Only Deals that have changed statuses since a certain date will appear in the "Deals That Have Gone Inactive section." The user can see everything that has moved out of the pipeline since the last pipeline meeting. This date can be customized by clicking directly on the date, or clicking the Settings button.


All metrics that appear on this page (such as IRR, Equity Multiple, and Cap Rate) can be entered in the "Deal Details" of an individual Deal by clicking Edit from the Action Menu.

**Overview**


The Pipeline Report is a valuable feature within dataIQ that offers a comprehensive view of an account's Deal List and related activities. Unlike the All Deals page, which displays all the deals in the your account, the Pipeline Report allows for grouping deals by Category, such as "Deals We're Working On" and "Deals That Have Gone Inactive since [select a date]," as well as by sub-categories. This helps you quickly identify and focus on specific deal types or stages.


Furthermore, the Pipeline Report is highly customizable, providing you with the ability to sort, filter, and export the report according to their preferences. This flexibility allows for efficient analysis and tracking of deals, enabling you to prioritize and manage their pipeline effectively right within redIQ.


**How do I access the Pipeline Report?**


The Pipeline Report is accessible from the Deals tab located at the top of the page, then by clicking on the Pipeline Report in the side navigation bar.

**What is the in-app experience with the Pipeline Report?**


To ensure a deal is included in the Pipeline Report, it must first be added to your Deal List on the All Deals page. The Pipeline Report offers a highly customizable and organized view of the deals within your account, allowing for efficient tracking throughout the acquisition lifecycle. Deals can be categorized and grouped as follows:


1. Deals We're Working On:
	* Active: Deals that are currently in progress.
	* Bid Placed: Deals for which a bid has been submitted.
	* Dormant: Deals that are temporarily inactive or on hold.
2. Deals That Have Gone Inactive Since [selected date]:
	* Closed: Deals that have been successfully closed.
	* Passed: Deals that have been rejected or not pursued further.
	* Lost: Deals that were not won by your company.
	* Withdrawn: Deals that have been voluntarily withdrawn from consideration.
	* Owned Property: Deals that have been acquired and are now owned by your company.


By categorizing and grouping deals in this manner, the Pipeline Report enables you to easily monitor and manage the progress and status of each deal, ensuring a clear overview of your acquisition pipeline. The groupings (*Active* through *Owned Property*) are based on the "Deal Status" field which can be updated in the Deal Status drop-down list on the *Deal Details* page.

In addition, the Status can be updated directly in the Pipeline Report if you have added the “Status” column to your report in the *Settings tab* (refer to the *“Settings*” section below).

*Deals That Have Gone Inactive Since* [selected date]: To set the start date for the Inactive Deals, click on the *“Settings”* button (refer to the *“Settings”* section below), then input the date in the “Pick Report Start Date” in the date picker input box. This date is used to limit the number of inactive deals that are displayed in the report.

In the next section, you can create filters based on settings contained within the Deal Details. This includes the Deal Status, Assigned To, Market, Zip, Fund, and Broker fields.

To export the report, click on the "Export" button located in the top navigation bar. A file will be generated, and you can save it to your preferred location. It's important to note that while the exported file will retain your customized settings, any filters you have applied within the Pipeline Report will not be recognized in the exported file. This allows you to leverage Excel's powerful filtering, sorting, and analytical features for in-depth analysis of the data.
