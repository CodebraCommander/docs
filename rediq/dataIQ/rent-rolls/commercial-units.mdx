redIQ asks for the total count of units in the rent roll. If your rent roll may contain commercial units, check to confirm that the value in this filed matches the number on the rent roll file.

redIQ lets users map floor plan unit types as either residential or commercial. The Commercial unit designations include: Retail, Office, Self-Storage, Industrial, Hotel, or Other.

Once the rent roll is fully mapped, from either the View Rent Roll or Edit Rent Roll pages you can export the rent roll to Excel in redIQ’s standard format. When you export the rent roll, you have the option of either including or excluding the commercial units. If you include the commercial units, the unit type column will be included in the rent roll.

Post mapping, users can edit the commercial Unit Type. On the Rent Roll screen, select Edit Rent Roll, then Mappings, and select Floor Plan. The commercial units can be mapped as Retail, Office, Self-Storage, Industrial, Hotel, or Other.
