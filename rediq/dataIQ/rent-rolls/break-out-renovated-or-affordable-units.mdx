title: Break Out Renovated or Affordable Units
---

If renovated or affordable units were labeled when mapping the data or on the [Edit Rent Roll screen](https://rediq.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000742265-edit-rent-roll-screen), they can be broken out in the Floor Plan Summary. Go to the Detail drop-down in the Report Settings of the Floor Plan Summary and select Renovated and/or Lease Type. This will separate the different levels of renovation and lease types of each floor plan in the summary.

Alternatively, the reports in Rent Roll Dashboard and Floor Plan Summary can be filtered so they only show certain levels of renovation or lease types and remove the rest of the units from the summary. This can be done using filters at the bottom of the Report Settings.
