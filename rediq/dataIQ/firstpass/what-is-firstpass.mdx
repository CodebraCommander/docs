title: What is FirstPass?
---

FirstPass (formerly known as QuickVal) allows redIQ users to screen deals confidently in minutes. A user simply uploads a rent roll and operating statement into redIQ, and the mapped data flows automatically into FirstPass, where the user can make a few simple assumptions (cap rate, income growth rate, vacancy rate, etc.). 


Adjustments will automatically generate a [pro forma cash flow table](kb://article/zendesk:rediq:360049900111), and users can walk away confidently with the purchase price of a property and associated deal return metrics.  


FirstPass allows users to make key assumptions resulting in a more accurate back of the envelope analysis in significantly less time, and it gives the user a jump start on their full underwriting.
