To produce a rolled-up cash flow, use the Map Operating Statements feature by assigning the line items of an operating statement to the Chart of Accounts. Refer to the [**Chart of Accounts**](chart-of-accounts)page on how to customize line items. 


### **Navigate to the Source Data**

After the initial mapping, click on the lock symbol to make changes to line item according to Chart of Accounts to edit. 


### **Map Line Items to The Account Column**


Either map individual line items skipping subtotals, OR map subtotals and skip line items to ensure you do not double count.

#### 
**redIQ's Legacy Mappings**


feature automatically maps line items in the current batch based on the batch selected from previous Operating Statements.



Legacy Mappings only applies selected batches that are good matches with the current file. The pre-selected batch contains the highest number of items that will be mapped. Items that have not been mapped will be highlighted in yellow. 


### **Applying Legacy Mappings**


Click on **Mappings** on the top of the page and select **Apply Legacy Mappings**

### **Using Batches**


The term "Batches" refers to the set of mappings given to a Deal that has already been mapped in your account. In the screenshot below, we can see the list of "Batches" available to choose from when choosing to apply Legacy Mappings. From the window, you can select the Best Match or the other options listed.
