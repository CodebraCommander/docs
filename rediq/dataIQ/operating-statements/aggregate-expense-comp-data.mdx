title: Aggregate Expense Comp Data
---

**Overview**


The Aggregate Expense Data feature will provide you with the ability to access and utilize aggregated operating expense data based on the geographic location of your deal. This data will be derived from internal redIQ sources which are comprised of the Operating Statement (“OS”) data that has been uploaded into redIQ from accounts that have opted in to share their aggregate data. This feature will be a free “beta” offering at first, providing operating expense market data for free for a limited period. You will have an opportunity to upgrade to the Lifecycle Management Suite in the future to access more data, including revenue and occupancy data, for an additional fee when available.


redIQ can provide data for all major markets, most secondary markets, and a few tertiary markets. The available markets are based on the volume of data available and will be increasing over time as users continue to upload operating statements.


As part of the Lifecycle Management Suite, this feature will resonate with Asset Managers and the management companies who are operating your assets. These roles will appreciate the ability to compare the operations of their assets to the overall market data.


Acquisition analysts will also find this feature helpful in reviewing the operating statements provided by the seller and comparing to the Market Data to find potential inefficiencies in current operations and identify areas where operations can be improved relative to the market.


**What is the in-app experience with Aggregate Expense Comp Data?**


The goal of this feature is to provide you with the ability to upload operating statements and compare the line-item accounts contained in those operating statements to the Market Data. In version 1.0, you will be able to compare the Subject Property data to the Market Data for the following account categories:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Controllable Expenses*** Repair & Maintenance
* Turnover / Make-Ready
* Personnel
* Marketing / Advertising
* Administrative
* Other Operating Expenses
* Contract Services
 |  **Non-Controllable Expenses*** Utilities
* Insurance
* Real Estate Taxes
* Property Management Fee
 |


**NOTE:** The account groupings have been mapped to a new level and therefore do not directly tie to the three viewing options available in dataIQ (Detailed Chart of Accounts, Chart of Accounts, or redIQ Categories.) The nearest comparison to these three options is the redIQ Categories. This was done in order to ensure consistent mappings and results across all user accounts.

We will be releasing Revenue (Rental Revenue, Other Revenue) and Occupancy (Avg Occupancy, Market Rent, Effective Rent, and In-Place Rent) later in 2024.


**How do I activate the Aggregate Expense Comps feature?**


To activate and utilize the Aggregate Expense Comps feature, your Account must have opted in to share your aggregate data. If your Account has not opted in, the users in your Account will see the following dialog box when accessing the new Market Comp Data (beta) page:

</Frame>


Note: If your account has already opted in to share your aggregate data, you will be able to view the Subject Property, Market Data, Variance calculations, and Quartiles data. If already opted in, you can skip to the “**How do I access and use the Aggregate Expense Comp Data?**” section beginning on page 6 below.


1. To activate, navigate to the Edit Account page (only the Account Administrator will have access to this page)


<Frame caption="Dropdown menu displaying account management options, including &quot;Edit Account.&quot;">

2. Under the “Privacy Preferences” section, select the “Opt-in” button for the Data Aggregation.

All users in your Account will now have access to the Aggregate Expense Comp (Beta) page.


**Assigning the deal to the correct Market**


In addition to opting the account into Data Aggregation, the deal must also have a complete and authentic address (including street, city, state, and zip code) to be assigned to a Market. In addition, the total number of residential units must be input. These are located on the Deal Details page.

**How do I access and use the Aggregate Expense Comp Data?**


To compare your deal’s operating expenses to the market data, under the Operating Statement tab select “Market Comp Data (Beta)” from the drop-down menu.

The Market Comp Data (Beta) page will provide the following information:


* Market: the market (or submarket) where the deal is located
* Number of Units: there are many markets where redIQ has a sufficient volume of data where we can provide more granular data based on property size. This will show which “bucket” the deal falls in such as <100, >100, >300, etc.
* Revenue: this is a future enhancement. Currently you will see a “Revenue Data Coming Soon!” banner in this section.
* Controllable Expenses and Non-Controllable Expenses: This is the section of the page that will compare the Subject Property (deal) to the Market Data, calculate both the dollar and percentage variance, and highlight the line items where the Subject Property expenses are greater than the Market Data.


The Market Data (along with the Quartiles) is derived from the redIQ database which is populated from the operating statements that have been uploaded by redIQ clients who have opted in to share their anonymized data (refer to #2 on page 5). We do not include any 3rd-party data in this dataset. By using only redIQ data, we can ensure that the data is both timely and accurate.


* It’s timely – we get hundreds, if not thousands, of operating statements and rent rolls uploaded each day. There isn’t as much of a lag in the redIQ market data as there is with most other 3rd-party providers.
* It’s accurate – the data goes directly from the user’s systems into redIQ without any modifications or enhancements along the way.

To get a better understanding of how your Subject Property compares to the Market Data, you can expand the table to display the quartiles for the Market Data by clicking on the Quartiles column header.


<Frame caption="Operating statement section with market details and quartiles option highlighted.">

</Frame>


You can now see where the Subject Property stands in comparison to the quartiles for each line item.

Clicking on the Quartiles column header again will hide those columns.


 


**FAQs**  



**Why do I see a banner that says there is insufficient data?**  
redIQ has a sufficient volume of data to provide market data for all major markets, most secondary markets, and a few tertiary markets. You may be working on a deal in a market where we do not have sufficient data and would be presented with a banner notifying you as such.


The Subject Property must have an operating statement uploaded into the deal. If there is no Subject Property data, rather than displaying $0’s, there will not be any Subject Property or Market Data displayed and you will see the “insufficient data” message.


The operating statements in the Subject Property must be recent (within the last 18 months). If the Subject Property data is older than 18 months, that will also trigger the “insufficient data” message.   



**Why is there an “N/A” in the variance percentage?**  
In rare cases, the Subject Property may not have any line items mapped to a particular account grouping so the Subject Property $/Unit = $0. In that case, instead of seeing an error in the percentage variance calculation, the report will display an “N/A” for the variance percentage.  



**Why am I only able to view the data from operating statements and not proforma data?**  
Only the data from uploaded operating statements in the Subject Property (deal) is available for comparison to Market Data. We are working with our Data Science team to determine the viability of adding the ability to compare proforma data to the market data. This presents a challenge as the proforma data is forward-looking (projections) whereas the market data is comprised of historical data.   



**What value does this provide, and who will benefit from using this feature?**  
The Market Comp Data feature provides users the ability to compare the financial operations of the deal to the aggregate Market Data based on the location of the deal. That data comes directly from redIQ and is both timely and accurate.


As part of the Lifecycle Management Suite, this feature will resonate with Asset Managers and the management companies who are operating your assets. These roles will appreciate the ability to compare the operations of their assets to the market data (refer to page 7 above).


Acquisition analysts will also find this feature helpful in reviewing the operating statements provided by the seller and comparing them to the Market Data to find potential inefficiencies in current operations and identify areas where operations can be improved relative to the market.
