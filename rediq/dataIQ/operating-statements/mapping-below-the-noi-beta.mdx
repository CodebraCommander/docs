title: Mapping Below the NOI - Beta
---

To map items below the NOI line, click on the Operating Statements tab in the selected deal, then click on the Source Data option. From there, users can scroll to their data below the marked NOI line and map their data below the NOI line just the same as when [mapping items above the NOI line](mapping-operating-statements.mdx).


When mapping below the NOI line, users must make sure they are using the specific account mappings meant for BNOI line items. If users map the BNOI line items using any other mappings than the BNOI specific mappings, the data will be incorrectly mapped and NOI lines will not match. The specific mappings will only contribute to the designated BNOI rows and if used above the NOI line, the data will be incorrectly mapped.

**(*In the example screenshot above, we can see that our BNOI lines (Calculated New Income, Original Net Income, Net Income Variance) match correctly. We can also see the BNOI mappings options listed in the dropdown)***


 


Listed below are the BNOI specific mapping accounts that are available to users when mapping below the NOI line items. These mappings can be found on your [Chart of Accounts](chart-of-accounts.mdx) and are able to be edited like the above the NOI mapping options.
