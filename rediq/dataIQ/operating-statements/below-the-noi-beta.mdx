#### 
 Beta Feature


This feature is currently in a free beta ahead of redIQ’s release of a standalone add-on, the Lifecycle Management Suite (“LMS”), focused on tracking the health and performance of portfolio properties. This feature will eventually be available only to LMS subscribers, but to deliver immediate value, redIQ has decided to make these features temporarily available to all users free of charge.



### **OVERVIEW**


Understanding the financial performance of a deal is essential for making informed investment decisions. Two crucial financial metrics used to evaluate multifamily properties are Net Operating Income (NOI) and Net Income. Both metrics provide insights into a property's financial health, enabling investors to make better-informed choices.


### ***What is the in-app experience with Below NOI?***


The goal of this feature is to provide users greater visibility into their deals and underwriting assumptions. redIQ clients who utilize the *Below NOI (“BNOI”)* feature will have the ability to upload operating statement data that includes account codes mapped below the NOI such as Debt Service, Capital Expenditures, Replacement Reserves, and other similar accounts.


### ***How do I upload operating statements that contain below NOI line items?***


*Note: this document assumes that you are already familiar with the basics of uploading operating* *statements and mapping accounts. For more information refer to the articles located [here](https://rediq.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360007244452-Historicals).*


**1.** Upload operating statement data into the associated deal in your Deal List.  
     a. Open the deal from the *All Deals* list  
     b. Navigate to *Operating Statement* > *Source Data*

**3.** Map the line items to the redIQ chart of accounts which now includes new account codes below the NOIusing either the *Code* or *Account columns*. For future uploads you can choose to apply Legacy Mappings or Automated Mappings.

**4.** When uploading and mapping is complete, navigate to *Operating Statement* > *Cash Flows*. By default, *Actuals* will be selected in the “View:” drop-down list. The data from the uploaded Operating Statement will now be displayed on the screen.

All accounts will be displayed, including those accounts below the NOI.

All other functionality remains unchanged. You will continue to have the same drop-down options to view the data:


* Adjusted Values, Adjustments, or Original Values
* $ totals, $ per unit, or $ per SF
* Overview, All Months, or All Years![Picture9.png](/images/rediq/1566877040c1eff8ca39683bb549ee42694fb3f0.png)


You will also be able to export the data to Excel, formatted based on your selections as outlined above.


### ***If I have a custom chart of accounts, will I need to modify it in the Account Settings page?***


It’s not required to modify the custom Chart of Accounts; however, if you have a custom Chart of Accounts for the line items above the Net Operating Income, you will likely want to add the new accounts that are below the NOI. The process of adding new accounts is unchanged - you will just need to add the new account name, create the code, then select the appropriate redIQ Category from the drop-down list which now includes the Below NOI categories.
