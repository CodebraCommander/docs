The Detailed Chart of Accounts is a way for users to view their Operating Statement data Averaged (Monthly) in multiple ways and shows the Total, Per Unit, Per Square Feet, and others. Having a detailed Chart of Account view makes it easy for a client to sync data, exported from the site, into their internal workflow. This view can be found by going to the “Operating Statement Comps” page found under the “Operating Statements” dropdown at the top of the page and selecting the “Detailed Chart of Accounts” option in the “View” dropdown.


In the screenshot below, you will see the “$ total / yr” breakdown. This shows the Average monthly Operating Statement data in a “total” view compared to other Deals and the Overall Account average.

If we change the “Units” view to “$ per unit / yr”, we can see that redIQ is now breaking down the Operating Statement data input to show Revenue and Operating Expenses on a Per Unit basis compared to other Deals and the Overall Account average.

The Detailed Chart of Accounts allows users to view the data in a view that incorporates any custom chart of accounts items used when mapping Operating Statement data. This helps easily incorporate any data uploaded into redIQ to their workflow without missing a beat.
