#### 
 Beta Feature


This feature is currently in a free beta ahead of redIQ’s release of a standalone add-on, the Lifecycle Management Suite (“LMS”), focused on tracking the health and performance of portfolio properties. This feature will eventually be available only to LMS subscribers, but to deliver immediate value, redIQ has decided to make these features temporarily available to all users free of charge.



### **OVERVIEW**


Real estate investors rely on projections and assumptions when evaluating potential investment opportunities. Proforma statements, which project the expected performance of a property, are one such tool. However, the actual performance of a property can differ from its projected performance. Therefore, it's important to compare operating statements to proformas to identify variances, evaluate performance, set future goals, and improve decision-making.


### ***What is the in-app experience for Proforma vs Actual?***


All redIQ clients who utilize the Proforma vs Actual (“PvsA”) feature will have the ability to upload up to three (3) different versions of their proforma (aka budget, scenario, etc.) along with their most recent historical financial data (operating statements). The PvsA will create the reports and analytics needed to enable users to compare the actual performance to various proforma scenarios to determine how the deal is performing and to identify potential areas where they can take corrective action if needed.


  
The goal of this feature is to provide users the ability to monitor and take corrective action on their deals by making comparisons of the actual financial performance versus the projected (proforma) plan(s). Typically, one of the three proformas will be the original underwriting which will allow clients to compare their original underwriting assumptions to actual results. Other uses are for budget comparisons or multiple-scenario options.


 


### ***How do I upload my proforma(s)?***


**Note:** *this assumes that you are already familiar with the process of uploading operating statements and mapping accounts. For more information refer to the articles located here.*


**1.** You will upload your proforma into the associated deal in your Deal List.  
     a. Open the deal from the All Deals list  
     b. Navigate to Operating Statement > Source Data

     c. Select the ![Picture12.png](/images/rediq/619f2cddac1324d116662f2c0b6d5be50f156e72.png) button in the top-right ribbon


     d. Select Upload Proforma 1 from the list

</Frame>


**2.** Upload the data for Proforma 1 using one of the four options  
     a. Drag & Drop the file  
     b. Select File button  
     c. Enter manually  
     d. Copy/Paste directly from Excel

</Frame>


**3.** Map the line items to their appropriate accounts  
     a. You must use the same mapping as the operating statements associated with the deal  
     b. Any method of mapping the line items that’s applicable to operating statements (manual, Legacy Mapping, etc.) is also applicable to mapping the proformas.  
  



**4.** When uploading and mapping is complete, navigate to Operating Statement > Cash Flows and select Proforma 1 from the “View:” drop-down list. The data from Proforma 1 will now be displayed on the screen.

</Frame>


**5.** Repeat as needed for Proforma 2 and Proforma 3


**NOTE**: if a proforma does not have any data uploaded, the proforma name will appear in italics in the Operating Statement > Source Data “View:” drop-down list (i.e., Proforma 2 and Proforma 3 in the screen shot below.)

### 
***How do I generate the Proforma vs Actual report?***


     a. To generate the Proforma vs Actual report, navigate to the Operating Statement > Cash Flows page for the deal. In the “View:” drop-down list, select the Proforma vs Actual Report option.

</Frame>


After you select Proforma vs Actual Report, you will need to choose the account output you prefer. You can select whether you want to use the Detailed Chart of Accounts, Chart of Accounts, or redIQ Categories output. By default, the selection in this drop-down list will be the same as what was selected in the prior Cash Flows page view.

The screen will display the message “To view this report, Export to Excel” with “Export to Excel” being a hyperlink. Another option is to use the Export to Excel button located in the upper-right corner of the page.

</Frame>


The Proforma vs Actual report will be downloaded to your computer. You can save the file to your computer or choose to open the file directly in Excel.


### ***Using the Proforma vs Actual Report***


When the file is opened in Excel, you may see a warning banner across the top of the screen. If so, you must press the “Enable Editing” button for the model to fully generate the Monthly Comparison tab in the report.

After editing is enabled, you will see worksheets for Monthly Actuals, each Proforma (from one to three separate tabs depending on how many proformas have been uploaded for the deal), Monthly Comparison, and About.

### **SELECTING THE REPORTS TO COMPARE**


The Monthly Comparison tab is where the user can perform the analysis of comparing any one tab to another. The most common use will be to compare actual operating data to any of the proformas; however, comparisons of one proforma vs. another are possible as well.


  
There are three drop-down lists at the top of the page. The “Report 1” and “Report 2” lists are used to select which tabs to compare, and the “Variance Type” list is used to determine if you want to view the variances as a dollar amount (“Dollars $”) or percentage (“Percent %”). By default, the Monthly Actuals and Proforma 1 are selected for Report 1 and Report 2 respectively, and “Dollars $” selected for the Variance Type.

### **REVIEWING THE REPORT**


The report uses conditional formatting to highlight the variances. Negative variances are highlighted in red, and positive variances are highlighted in green. Different shades of red and green are used to highlight the range of the variances, with lighter shades indicating smaller variances. The shades increase in intensity as the amount of the variances increase.

Additional considerations:


* The Operating Statement and Proforma data must be monthly.
* Full Excel functionality is available so you can utilize that functionality to create additional analyses with the data. Examples are adding Total columns, calculating quarterly sums, creating year-over-year analysis, and more.


### ***Does the time range of the comparisons need to be identical?***


**![Picture25.png](/images/rediq/a7923a58c50b6f2c01750514a3334f45a6495aeb.png)**


No; however, the output will be based on the time periods contained in the Operating Statement (“Monthly Actuals”) data. In the example shown above, the Operating Statement goes from July 2021 through June 2022, and the Proforma data is the 2022 Operating Budget which goes from January through December 2022. As you can see, there was no proforma data for July through December 2021 so the variance = 100.00% or 0.00% for all line items. Similarly, there was no Operating Statement after June 2022, so that is the last month displayed in the report. As more Operating Statement data is uploaded in future months, those months will be displayed in the report.


### ***Do the Actuals and Proformas need to be monthly?***


Yes, the Proforma vs Actual report is designed to show the monthly comparisons. Since the output is in Excel, you can create formulas for annual, quarterly, MOM / YOY, etc. within the report.
