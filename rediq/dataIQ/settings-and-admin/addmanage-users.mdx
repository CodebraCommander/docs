#### 
 Admin Role Required


You must have the role "Corporate Admin" to manage users. If you do not know who your admins are, contact redIQ support.



To add a username for a colleague, click your name in the top right corner of the screen and select Manage Users. A screen will appear with a list of all users associated with the redIQ account. Using the action buttons in the top right, new users can be added or existing users can be edited. Note that only users with the "Corporate Administrator" role can make these changes.
