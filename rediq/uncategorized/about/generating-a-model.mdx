Select or Create a Deal
-----------------------

Log into your redIQ account and select a deal from the "All Deals" section of the Deals page

---------------------

Upload at least one rent roll and at least one fully mapped operating statement to provide enough data to generate the model. The Upload button can be found in the upper right-hand corner of the deal regardless of which tab you are in. Click the button to see document upload options.

Generate Model
--------------

Now that you have all your underlying data, click the Generate Model button in the top right-hand corner of your deal page. This will open a pop-up window with a few questions and a link to color customization options.

Enabling Macros
---------------

When you press OK you will download the model in an Excel file. Click the file to open it. If it opens in "Protected View" you will see a yellow bar at the top of the document with an "Enable Editing" button. 

![Protected View.png](/images/rediq/09f38367f37e9886532d9fae2aef1befda3be305.png)Clicking that may then populate a new Security Risk message. The model relies on macros for its most powerful features and will not work without unblocking macros. 

![Security Risk.png](/images/rediq/f1c8620a8481df8e0c98e1dcb969ae02ac560298.png)To disable these security features, you will want to create a trusted folder that models can be saved to in order to reduce manual override for each file. **Details can be found here:** [**Blocked Macros in valuationIQ Model**](kb://article/zendesk:rediq:9034902945812)**.**

If you want to override a single file, you can do so by finding the file in its folder, right clicking the file and selecting Properties. 

![Unblock Macros.png](/images/rediq/bf2037446bc6b6934b97248ab7412498c5ad9982.png)Check the "Unblock" box and press OK. You will then be able to use macros in the selected document.
