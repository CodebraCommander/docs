### **To run an Aggregate Analysis:**


Within the Comps page, there is an option to aggregate two or more Operating Statements into one complete Operating Statement file. Similar to running a “Comp Analysis”, to run a Aggregate Analysis, click the “Comps” option in the top left corner of the screen. By default, the Operating Statements option is selected, however a Rent Roll report can be run by selecting the corresponding button above the list of deals.

Check the box next to each deal that should be included in the Aggregate report, and click the "Aggregate " button, just to the right of the “Comparables” button. The list of deals can be filtered by using the Selection Criteria on the left side of the screen.



##### 
**Note**


*Only deals with 12 or more months of Operating Statements will appear in the Aggregate report.*
