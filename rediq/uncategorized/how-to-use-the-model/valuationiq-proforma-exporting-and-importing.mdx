With the ability to upload proforma data to your deal in redIQ, users can also generate and export proforma data from their own redIQ generated model. This feature allows users to deep dive into their data with the ability to generate and review multiple proforma models.


The process below walks through the steps needed to generate and export data from an existing model, as well as deliver the needed template to input into your generated model. Once you have generated and exported the data to Excel, you can then upload and map the exported Excel file into one of the proforma upload options (proforma 1, 2 or 3) as you normally would with an operating statement.


To begin, start by downloading the proforma exporter template [here](https://multifamily.rediq.com/l/534952/2023-07-27/25qm7f). 



1. On your RedIQ ‘All Deals’ page, select the deal that you would like to create the proforma Export.

3. Once the model is generated, open the proforma export. Click and hold the ‘Proforma Export’ tab and drag to the bottom of model.

4. At the top of the ‘Proforma Export’ worksheet, click the button labeled ‘Link to Model’.

5. The cells within the page will populate with the proforma calculations from the model and the ‘Link to Model’ button will disappear leaving only the ‘Export’ button.

6. Clicking the ‘Export’ button will prompt you to save the export in the relevant folder then open the export worksheet separate from the model. Assumptions must be completely entered in model, otherwise proforma data won't fully deliver.   


 


7. After exporting, you can then import the same file into redIQ by going to the deal in your account and selecting proforma 1, 2, or 3. This will open a window giving you the option to select the exported file to upload.


8. Once the data has been uploaded, you will need to map the data as you would an operating statement and start reviewing your newly uploaded proforma data.
