The redIQ model is built to underwrite stabilized multifamily residential properties. However, a commercial component can be added into the model if needed. To add Commercial Cash Flow go to Model Settings in the redIQ tab of the Ribbon, click the Other drop-down and select Commercial Component. This will create another input tab where the Commercial Cash Flow of the property can be entered. Keep in mind this is not a mixed use model, so there are no formulas or cells built to enter separate assumptions for the commercial space. This allows you to factor projected commercial NOI into the model, but you'll have to determine how to arrive at those numbers.
